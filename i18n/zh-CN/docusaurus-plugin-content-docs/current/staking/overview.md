description: Zilliqa Seed Node Staking Overview
---
Welcome to the seed node staking section. Staking in Zilliqa has been implemented in several phases.

## Phase 0
[Phase 0](phase0/staking-introduction) is the initial, ongoing phase of the seed node staking program. Phase 0 is formally described in [ZIP-3](https://github.com/Zilliqa/ZIP/blob/master/zips/zip-3.md).

The goals of phase 0 are:
- Open up the seed nodes network to more operators
- Introduce staking at the seed node operation level

A seed node within the staking program is referred to as a **Staked Seed Node** or **SSN**.

## Phase 1
[Phase 1](phase1/staking-phase1-overview) is the upcoming phase of SSN staking. Phase 1 is formally described in [ZIP-11](https://github.com/Zilliqa/ZIP/blob/master/zips/zip-11.md). Phase 1 is expected to replace phase 0.

Phase 1 builds on top of phase 0, and further introduces these features:
- A mechanism for stake delegation, which removes the need to deposit $ZIL with an intermediary custodian
- Uncapped staking
- Stake rewards in the form of gZIL token, a ZRC-2 compliant governance token
- Bonding of stake amount
